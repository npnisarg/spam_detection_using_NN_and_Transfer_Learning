# spam_detection_using_NN_and_Transfer_Learning


In this project, we will build a recurrent neural network to classify a SMS text message as "spam" or "not spam". In the process, you will learn how to,
    
1. Clean and process text data for machine learning.
2. Understand and implement a character-level recurrent neural network.
3. Use torchtext to build recurrent neural network models. (LSTM model)
4. Understand batching for a recurrent neural network, and use torchtext to implement RNN batching.
5. Understand how transfer learning can be applied to NLP projects.
